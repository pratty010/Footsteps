# Text Generation with Vector Indexes and LangChain

## Overview
Text generation using a vector index with LangChain allows you to create applications that can reference a large body of custom text, such as generating blog posts or product tutorials.

## Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Fetch documentation content from a repository on GitHub.
2. **Splitting into Chunks**: Split the fetched documents into smaller chunks using `CharacterTextSplitter`.
3. **Vector Indexing**: Store these chunks in a vector index for efficient retrieval.
4. **Creating an LLM Chain**: Set up a simple LLM chain with a custom prompt for text generation.
5. **Applying Inputs to the Chain**: Use inputs like context and topic to generate text based on the retrieved documents.
